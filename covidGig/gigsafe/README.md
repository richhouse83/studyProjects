### GigSafe proof of concept

This is a proof of concept for a service to help live music venues operate during the Global Pandemic.

Built using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js

The system allows venues to register and add shows. The individual would then register their phone number, which could be registered at the venue using perhaps a QR code. 
Then if a person gets a positive test, they can register that status and every show within that venue is marked, and all the contact details made available for contact tracing.
